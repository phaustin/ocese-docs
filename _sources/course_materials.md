# Course material

## Getting started

For those just beginning to use Git, GitHub, Jupyter, Python, Jupyter books, see the DOCUMENTATION section of this website.

## Course transformations

**All the course material below is under development as of October, 2020**

Some courses will have all (or most) material converted for deployment using Jupyter Books, others will include Python programming requirements, and some will have new interactive dashboards built for illustrating and exploring quantitative processes and concepts in courses taken by students in other disciplines.

* [EOSC 211](https://andrewloeppky.github.io/eosc211/title_211.html)
* [ATSC 301](https://phaustin.github.io/a301_code/)
* [ATSC 409](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/numeric/)
* EOSC 340

Other courses likely to be impacted between 2020 and 2023 include EOSC 350, EOSC 354, EOSC 410/510, EOSC420, EOSC442, EOSC329, EOSC429, EOSC372, EOSC373, EOSC471, DSCI 100.

**Examples from outside this project**
